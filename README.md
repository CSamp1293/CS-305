### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. These financial plans include savings accounts, retirement, investments, and insurance. As a developer for the software engineering company Global Rain, I was tasked with helping the client, Artemis Financial, modernize their operations and include the most current and effective software security standards. 

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I feel I did very well producing a checksum verification to ensure secure coding practices were utilized. One of the most important aspects of security starts at the base with secure coding. Specifically, by producing a checksum verification, I have ensured that any customer information that Artemis Financial stores in their database is securely hidden through the "golden standard" of encryption. In the age of technology, it is crucial to focus on software security and make it a priority since there are more frequent and dangerous attacks/exploits that can cause major issues for a company. 

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
When the vulnerability report was produced, it felt like reading through a foreign manual. However, with some research and viewing exploits that were discovered on OWASP, I was able to read through the report more throroughly. This report ended being a big help to make decisions such as which algorithm cipher is best to use given the known vulnerabilities. 

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, it was imortant to add a safe, secure, and current algorithm cipher. In the future, I would definitely use the Maven Dependency Check and OWASP to assess vulnerabilities and determine my mitigation technique. Another added security layer is the authentication process required for interaction with certain features on the application, this is important to implement to avoid attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) or basically, the wrong person getting access to something they shouldn't have access to. 

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Testing. The best way to determine functionality and security is testing. Whether the testing is done manually or automated, testing is the absolute best way to determine these things. With the projects specifically, I used both automation testing and manually reviewed the code both before and after refactorization. 

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I found the tutorials on reading and generating the vulnerability reports the most helpful as I felt very lost when trying to read the report on my own. I also found the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram useful for determining specific areas of security to focus on given information about a company. 

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers the whole project. I would breakdown each section with what was expected, and walkthrough what I did to get to the final product. I would seize the opportunity and look at it like a sales pitch, I would "sell" my abilities and tanacity to them through this portfolio, as long as the position regards software security of course.
